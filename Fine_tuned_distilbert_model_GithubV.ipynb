        "This notebook prepares the environment by installing necessary libraries, importing modules, mounting Google Drive, and setting up directories. It then loads and cleans the dataset, applying a text cleaning function and setting up label mappings. To address class imbalance, the training data is oversampled. The datasets are then tokenized using the DistilBERT tokenizer. A function for computing evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score is defined. The DistilBERT model for sequence classification is loaded, and training parameters are defined. The model is then initialized and trained using the Hugging Face Trainer on the prepared datasets. After training, the fine-tuned model and tokenizer are saved to Google Drive. Finally, the trained model is evaluated on the test set, a confusion matrix is generated, and training and validation metrics are visualized."
